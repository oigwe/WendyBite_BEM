				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/Betty-White.jpg" alt="Betty White photo">
				<p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorc&#233;e) sharing a house in
					Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by
					fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorc&#233;e Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a
					room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook
					named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother,
					Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[6][7]
